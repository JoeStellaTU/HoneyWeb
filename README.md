The goal of HoneyWeb is to create an entire Web of Honeypots/Honeytokens to bait an attack to dive deep it a fake system. Not only would this allow for a system to track down an IP and Port, it would provide an indepth analysis of the attack and would provide a layer of Security through defense. Much like the spider's web, the ideal scenario for the HoneyWeb would be to trap an attack. The metaphor that inspired the idea was "digging in the wrong place".

Config: the current proof of concept is a very basic example and requires no specific instructions to run.
